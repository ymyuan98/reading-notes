## Abstract

Marginal structural models (MSMs) are becoming increasingly popular as a tool for causal inference from longitudinal data, as they can adjust for time-dependent observed confounders while avoiding the bias due to the direct adjustment for covariates affected by the treatment.

## Keywords

Causal inference; **Covariate balancing propensity score (CBPS)**; Inverse propensity score weighting; Observational studies; Sequential ignoreability; Time-dependent treatments (**longitudinal data**).
