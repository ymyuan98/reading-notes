# A repository for reading notes

This repository contains notes of papers 
that are chosen only depending on my interim interest. 
Notes of textbooks are also documented. 

The primary goal is to find a research direction that I am passionate about. 
The ultimate goal is to cultivate a good reading habit. 


## How to read papers? 

Here is an instruction of reading academic papers (great thanks to Professor Lucy Gao for sharing this website!): 
[A guide to read academic papers](https://github.com/jtleek/readingpapers). 

Always be critical! 

When reading a paper, always pay attention to the questions listed below (stealed from Prof. Yongjin Park's QP requirements): 


- **Problem definition**: 
  - Extract mathematical/statistical problems from the paper and organize them. 
  - What kind of statistical questions it is dealing with? 
  - What are the input data? (Any characteristics of the data?)
  - What is the expected output?

- **Author's contribution (Methods)**:
  - Describe the proposed method in your own words.
  - How did the author(s) find the solution? 
  - What was a novel contribution beyond traditional approaches?

- **Significance** (summarize it briefly): 
  - Why is this an interesting problem? 
  - What can be learned by studying this problem? 
  - Why is it exciting for you? 
  - Author contribution: 
    

- **Limitations/challenges** (summarize it briefly):
  - What are the assumptions? 
  - Are they realistic? 
  - What are the technical limitations that the authors acknowledge or not?
  - What can be extended from this proposed method? Describe it more specifically! The discussion shouldn't be too shallow.. 

- **Epilogue**:
  - Is the proposed method related to any other concepts/previous methods? 
  - Any other comments? 


## How about reading a book? 

The target of reading a book is to study a new field. 
So I guess the point here is to write down frameworks and also technical details - whatever I believe is important - provided in the book. 

## So... 

Let's get started!
